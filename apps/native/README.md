## Why?

For my interest, I wanted to try tamagui. But, I often write native modules and I like to have full control over the application. And I didnâ€™t find any guide on how to integrate Tamagui + React Native app.

So, I decided to just do it, maybe it will help others.

## ðŸ”§ Integration

_with React Native 0.75.3_

### 0. Add tamagui to dependencies

If you have only native app, so just install tamagui:
```bash
yarn add tamagui
```
But, if you have monorepo, I recommend install tamagui only in ui-like package. In example `@my/ui`.

### 1. Change (native) paths to `node_modules`

If you have only react-native app - skip this step.

As tamagui often with monorepo, it provides `node_modules` in root of monorepo, so we need to change paths.

- Edit `metro.config.js` to resolve monorepo root path

### Android specific
- Change paths in `android/app/build.gradle`
- Change paths in `android/settings.gradle`
- Fill variables in `android/build.gradle`

### 2. Setup tamagui compiler

As tamagui provides compiler, we should not miss the opportunity to connect it ðŸ˜Œ

```bash
yarn add --dev @tamagui/babel-plugin
```

And make changes in `babel.config.js`.
